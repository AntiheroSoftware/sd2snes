How to build:

a) Build requirements
 * make
 * Cortex M3 toolchain
 * snescom/sneslink
 * Xilinx FPGA synthesis tool (e.g. ISE WebPack)
 * PIC assembler

b) Cortex M3 toolchain
 * obtain the cm3-toolchain builder:
   git clone http://snowcat.de/toolchain-cm3.git/
 * build the cm3-toolchain. Some tools, libraries, and headers are required,
   including but probably not limited to:
    - libz-dev
    - libcloog-ppl-dev
    - texinfo
    - libmpfr-dev
    - libgmp3-dev
    - gawk
    - bison
    - recode
    - flex
    - libncurses5-dev
    - libexpat-dev
    - make
    - gcc
   Newer gccs complain when compiling binutils, so you may have to add
   '--disable-werror' to the compiler options for binutils in the Makefile.
   The Makefile will install immediately so make sure you can write to the
   installation directory.

c) snescom/sneslink
 * http://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/snescom.html

d) ISE WebPack
 * http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.htm

e) PIC assembler
 * e.g. GPUTILS, http://gputils.sourceforge.net/

f) general order of operations
 1) program the PIC (cic/supercic/supercic-key.asm)
 2) build and program the bootloader.
 3) build the firmware and copy it to the memory card
 4) build the snes menu and copy it to the memory card
 5) build and compress the FPGA configuration and copy it to the memory card
 6) insert memory card, power on; the bootloader should begin flashing the
    firmware and boot it

1) Programming the PIC
Use a PIC assembler + programmer of your choice and program a PIC12F629 with
cic/supercic/supercic-key.asm. Make sure that the clock source is set to
EC_OSC and MCLRE is disabled.
After programming you can solder the PIC to the board and short JP401.
Open JP401 in case you need to reprogram the PIC on board.

2) Building & programming the bootloader
The Makefile is prepared for JTAG programming using OpenOCD 0.4 and an FT2232
based USB-JTAG adapter.
Connect a JTAG cable to J401 (14-pin header). The pinout is printed on the
board. cd to src/bootldr and make && make program.

3) Building the firmware
cd to src/utils and make.
cd to src/ and make.
You should obtain a firmware file called obj/firmware.img. Copy this file to
<sdcard>/sd2snes/firmware.img.

4) Building the SNES menu
snescom is required.
cd to snes/ and make.
Copy the resulting file menu.bin to <sdcard>/sd2snes/menu.bin.

5) Building the FPGA configuration
Compile the RLE compressor in utils/rle.c:
 $ gcc -Wall -o rle rle.c

Load verilog/sd2snes/sd2snes.xise in Xilinx ISE (or create your own project).
Target is a XC3S400-4PQ208.
Generate the programming file and compress it using utils/rle.c:
 $ rle main.bit fpga_base.bit

Copy fpga_base.bit to <sdcard>/sd2snes/fpga_base.bit
